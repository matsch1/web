## impressions
This morning, after a night without a thunderstorm, it was difficult to get out of the tent.It was suddenly cold, cloudy and windy.

An hour later than yesterday, things went quite well again.It was extremely windy.The wind came from mainly from the side, and sometimes even from behind, but the main thing is not from the front.

Shortly after crossing the huge and old bridge Storstrømsbroen, I came across au Joana and Christian.When chatting, we noticed that we are aimed at almost the same daily goal, whereupon we decided to drive the remaining 70 km together.

The route went a lot through hill through the domestic hill today.Since the tour snapped through the terrain, the wind felt felt like it was from all sides.For this we treated ourselves to a delicious lunch during the break.

In the afternoon, a hiss from my rear tires brought me back to reality.At one point a larger hole can be seen in the tire.With Tubeless Salami, however, this was tight again in a very short time and we can continue the tour.

Shortly before Køge, our paths broke up again.The two are in one accommodation and I was looking for a shelterplatz.
