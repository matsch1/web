## Impressions
This morning, after a night without a thunderstorm, I found it difficult to get out of the tent. It was suddenly cold, cloudy and windy.

An hour later than yesterday, things went quite well again. It was extremely windy. The wind came mainly from the side, and sometimes even from behind, but the main thing was not from the front.

Shortly after crossing the huge and old Storstrømsbroen bridge, I bumped into Joana and Christian. While chatting, we realized that we were heading for almost the same destination, so we decided to ride the remaining 70 km together.

The route today involved a lot of hills through the countryside. As the tour meandered through the terrain, it felt like the wind was coming from all sides. In return, we treated ourselves to a delicious lunch during the break.

In the afternoon, a hissing sound from my rear tires brought me back to reality. At one point there was a large hole in the tire. With tubeless salami, however, this was sealed again in a very short time and we were able to continue the tour.

Shortly before Køge, we went our separate ways again. The two of them went to a shelter and I looked for a place to stay.
