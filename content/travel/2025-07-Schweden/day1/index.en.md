## Impressions
Got off quite early today. When it's light from just after 4, it doesn't seem like it. With just a coffee for breakfast, I just set off. On the way I ate the leftovers from yesterday and then somehow I was at the ferry in no time. The first 70 km went by like nothing.

Just lots of new, beautiful impressions.

So I finished my cycling day relatively early and went for a swim in the Baltic Sea in great weather.
