## The plan
I will ride my bike through Denmark, Sweden and Norway for a month.
I would like wild camps and the many beautiful shelter spaces of the
Use Scandinavian countries.
My luggage should be as light as possible, but an everything necessary for one
Offer month.

## route
The rough route planning goes through the following cities with start and end in Flensburg:
Copenhagen, Gothenburg, Oslo, Larvik, Hirtshals, Esbjerg
I would like to cycle about 100 km every day.

### Section 1: Flensburg to Helsingborg (Sweden)

### Section 2: Helsingborg to Gothenburg (Sweden)
The journey in Sweden begins with the west coastal cycle path (Kattegattlede) to Gothenburg.

### Section 3: Gothenburg to Oslo (Norway)
This section is still unclear.Probably cycle along the coast because this section
should be particularly beautiful.

### Section 4: Oslo to Hirtshals (Denmark)
This section is still unclear.That also depends on how much time
I still stay.The short way would be to be overlooked via Larvik to Denmark.The
Somewhat longer path is still lying on the Norwegian coast and then from
Christiansand in Hirtshals in Denmark.

### Section 5: West Coast Cycle Path (Denmark)
If the wind allows it, I will become the last section to Flensburg, on the
West coastal cycle path Denmark, roll.

For convenience, I leave the triathlon handlebar on the handlebars and arms on wide tubeless tunnel tires.
