## The plan
I'm going to cycle through Denmark, Sweden and Norway for a month.
I want to wild camp and use the many beautiful shelter sites in the
Scandinavian countries.
My luggage should be as light as possible, but have everything I need for a month's trip.
month trip.

## Route
The rough route is planned to start and end in Flensburg and pass through the following cities:
Copenhagen, Gothenburg, Oslo, Larvik, Hirtshals, Esbjerg
I would like to cycle approx. 100 km a day.

### Section 3: Gothenburg to Oslo (Norway)
This section is still unclear. Probably cycle along the coast, as this section is said to be
is said to be particularly beautiful.

### Section 4: Oslo to Hirtshals (Denmark)
This section is still unclear. It also depends on how much time
I have left. The shortest route would be to cross over to Denmark via Larvik. The
longer route would be along the Norwegian coast and then from Christiansand to
Christiansand to Hirtshals in Denmark.

### Section 5: West Coast Cycle Route (Denmark)
If the wind allows it, I will cycle the last section to Flensburg on the
West Coast Cycle Route of Denmark.

## Bicycle
My bike is a Cube Nuroad C:62SL. With its carbon frame and fork, as well as electronic gears, it's only partially suitable for a tour like this. But I just hope that the carbon won't mind so much luggage.

For comfort, I'm leaving the triathlon handlebar attachment on and upgrading to wide tubeless studded tires.
