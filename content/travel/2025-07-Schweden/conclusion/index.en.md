## Impressions
I've now spent 21 days traveling in Denmark, Sweden and Germany.
I spent about 2 days on the train, took a day off in Sweden and spent a day with friends in Cologne.

Unfortunately, the south of Sweden didn't really impress me on this solo trip.
Most of the time, the Kattegattleden west coast cycle route ran through tourist regions, industrial areas or along main roads.
Although this was not entirely unexpected, it was unfortunately confirmed.
You can easily escape the hustle and bustle inland. Just a few kilometers from the coast, you drive alone through the forest, far away from people, supermarkets and shelters. However, as a solo traveler, I didn't feel like that for several days.
That's why I decided to take the last ferry back to Denmark before Oslo.

For me, Denmark is the perfect mix of civilization and wilderness.
You pass through towns and tourist areas at regular intervals, but you can get out of them just as quickly.
You can easily stock up on food and still spend a lot of time in beautiful nature.
As a solo traveler, I also find the shelter concept much more pleasant than the everyman's right in Sweden.
You get to talk to other travelers more often instead of pitching your tent somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
So Denmark was once again a dream. Not only because the country is so beautiful, but also because the people are always super open and friendly.

The finish with Jan on the Rhine Cycle Route felt like civilization again.
The section we cycled is also really beautiful, but doesn't really have much to do with nature.
Maybe it was because I was no longer alone, but the day trips also felt more like such.
I was no longer a traveler, but simply on a nice day trip as usual.
