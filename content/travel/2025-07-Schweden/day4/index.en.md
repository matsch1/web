## Impressions
Another slow start this morning. It was cold and the day's destination unclear.

I took lots of breaks and relaxed.

I rolled through Copenhagen at a leisurely pace, looked at a few things and drank a delicious coffee.

Finding a place to sleep was a bit chaotic today. My original plan was to stay with someone from the warmshowers community. Unfortunately, both my requests were turned down. At the same time, I was invited by a Reddit user to his home in Copenhagen. However, that didn't really work out, as I wanted to be as close as possible to the ferry to Sweden today. That's why I ended up in a shelter near Niv책 again.
Strangely enough, all the shelters in this part of Denmark are chargeable or have to be booked.

Well, protected from the rain, I end the evening in my shelter. Unfortunately, the next few days don't promise any better weather. But I have to find somewhere to charge my electronic devices and do my laundry tomorrow anyway. Let's see how the next few days go.
