title: Day 4 - Copenhagen

## impressions
Started slowly this morning.It was cold and the daily goal was unclear.

I took a lot of breaks and relaxed.

I rolled through Copenhagen comfortably, looked at a few things and drank a delicious coffee.

The search for sleeping place was a bit chaotic today.My original plan was to be overwhelmed with someone from the Warmshowers Community.Unfortunately, my two inquiries were rejected.At the same time, I was invited to home in Copenhagen by a Reddit user.However, this did not really fit, because today I wanted to go to the ferry to Sweden as close as possible.For this reason, I landed again in a shelter near Niv책.
Oddly enough, all shelter spaces in this part of Denmark are subject to a fee.

Well, protected by the rain, I now let the evening end in my shelter.Unfortunately, the next few days do not promise better weather.But for tomorrow I have to search for accommodation for charging my electronic devices and washing for laundry.Let's see how the next few days are going.
