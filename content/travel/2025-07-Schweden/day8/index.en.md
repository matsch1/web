## impressions
This morning I finally started again in bright sunshine.Along the coast we went through dunes and forests to Halmstad, where I had breakfast at the harbor.

Unfortunately, after Halmstad, the Kattlegattle mainly walked along some streets.It was not so nice to look at, but almost invited to make a lot of distance.If it hadn't been the headwind.I don't think I need to mention it in the future.It's always windy.

As a daily destination, I chose a shelter in the interior.The coast is much too densely populated to camp wildly.There are no shelter spaces and I didn't feel like it at campsites.

As soon as you remove from the coast, the landscape feels much more to Sweden.You drive through many forests and I had to shop my dinner 20 km before the finish line, otherwise there are no more supermarkets.

However, this also turned out to be a good decision, since I came across other cyclists again at Shelterplatz.A dinner among like -minded people is more fun.

I decided to take the ferry back to Denmark the day after tomorrow.For me, the concept with the shelter spaces simply fits better than crossing the wilderness of Sweden alone.More on that the next few days.
