## Impressions
This morning I finally set off again in bright sunshine. I cycled along the coast through dunes and forests to Halmstad, where I had breakfast at the harbor.

After Halmstad, the Kattlegattle unfortunately mainly ran along roads. It wasn't so nice to look at, but it would almost have invited me to do a good stretch. If it hadn't been for the headwind. I don't think I need to mention that in future. It's always windy.

I chose a shelter inland as my destination for the day. The coast is far too densely populated to camp in the wild. There are no shelter sites there either and I didn't fancy camping.

As soon as you move away from the coast, the landscape feels much more like Sweden. You drive through many forests and I had to buy my dinner 20 km before my destination, as there are no other supermarkets.

However, this turned out to be a good decision, as I once again met other cyclists at the shelter. Having dinner with like-minded people makes it even more fun.

I've decided to take the ferry back to Denmark the day after tomorrow. For me, the concept of the shelter sites is simply better than crossing the Swedish wilderness on my own.
