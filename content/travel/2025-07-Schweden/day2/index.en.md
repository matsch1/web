## Impressions
Last night in the tent was surprisingly good. After a cup of coffee, I set off at a leisurely pace and then rode 50 km to the ferry to Lolland.

I then had breakfast on the sun deck with the best view.

After getting off the ferry, my good mood was dampened by a 30 km stretch with a disgusting headwind. Once I had managed this, I rewarded myself with a big pizza followed by a dip in the Baltic Sea.

A big thunderstorm with 15l/m² is forecast for tonight. For this reason, I set off early again in search of a covered place to sleep. It worked out right away today too.
When the storm arrives, the temperature is expected to drop significantly.

I let the evening fade away comfortably with the residual warmth of the day.
