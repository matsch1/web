## impressions
Last night in the tent was surprisingly good.Comfortable after a coffee and then I started 50 km to the ferry to Lolland.

On the sundeck, I was able to have breakfast my remains from yesterday with the best view.

Down away from the ferry, the good mood was steamed from a distance of 30 km, with a disgusting headwind.After I had mastered this, I rewarded myself with a fat pizza and a subsequent bath in the Baltic Sea.

For tonight, a fat storm is predicted with 15l/m².For this reason, I started looking for a covered place of sleep early.Even today, that worked out right now.
When the storm comes, a significant fall in temperature can be expected.

I now let the evening end comfortably with the residual heat of the day.
