## impressions
After giving yesterday's evening with Danish hikers around the campfire, I started this morning in bright sunshine.

I first drove 15 km into Germany with the wrong route on the navigation system.Fortunately, that did not send me in the completely wrong direction, but only cost a few kilometers of the west coast bike path.

Until the lunch break, the route was mainly on gravel slopes through beautiful dunes and forests.

After the lunch break, the tailwind and Limp Bizkit somehow meant that a fuse burned with me.From then on, music continued to south on the ears.I felt the last 70 km at a speed over 30 km/h until I ended up at the ferry port.If there had been no ferry, I would probably still fly through the dunes.

As a result of this long daily distance, I ended up at a campsite where I was already with Jonas 2 years ago.
Here I was able to shower hot, wash the laundry and charge batteries.In addition, I got to know Dirk with which I spent a nice end on the beach.
