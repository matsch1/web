## Impressions
After ending yesterday evening around a campfire with Danish hikers, I set off this morning in bright sunshine.

At first I took the wrong route on the sat nav and drove 15 km inland. Fortunately, this didn't send me in the completely wrong direction, but only cost me a few kilometers of the West Coast Cycle Route.

So until the lunch break, the route was mainly on gravel roads through beautiful dunes and forests.

After the lunch break, a tailwind and Limp Bizkit somehow caused me to blow a fuse. From then on, I continued south at full throttle with music in my ears. I drove what felt like the last 70 km at a speed of over 30 km/h until I landed at the ferry port. If there hadn't been a ferry, I would probably still be flying through the dunes.

As a result of this long daily distance, I ended up at a campsite that I had already been to 2 years ago with Jonas.
Here I was able to take a hot shower, do laundry and recharge my batteries. I also got to know Dirk, with whom I spent a nice evening on the beach.
