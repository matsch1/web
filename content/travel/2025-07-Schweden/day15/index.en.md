## impressions
The day started today with dense fog.Without the sun was not to think about getting the tent somehow.So I had to pack everything soaked in the gossip.

After 10 km on the bike I reach Ribe, the former capital Denmark.At 9 a.m. it was still quite overslept the beautiful old town and unfortunately I couldn't look at the interior of the Vikinger Cathedral.

From then on it went almost aif directly towards Flensburg.Unfortunately, it started to rain and I felt like I was on the only street in Denmark without a bike path.

So on the last day I struggled through the rain in Denmark on the street.Unfortunately, that was not what I had introduced.But I was also glad that I was not traveling under such conditions on my previous trip.

So I drove the route relatively quickly to spend the evening with friends in Flensburg.With 3 delicious fish rolls in a nice company, we ended the evening together.

From Flensburg I go by train to Cologne, where after 2 days of rest I will start my way home on the Rhine cycle path.
