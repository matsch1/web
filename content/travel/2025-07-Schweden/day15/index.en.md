## Impressions
The day started today in thick fog. Without sunshine, it was impossible to even think about getting the tent any kind of sign. So I had to pack everything soaking wet.

After 10 km on the bike I reached Ribe, the former capital of Denmark. At 9 a.m., the beautiful old town was still pretty sleepy and unfortunately I couldn't see the inside of the Viking cathedral.

From there, it was almost a direct route towards Flensburg. Unfortunately, it started to rain and I felt like I was on the only road in Denmark without a cycle path.

So on the last day in Denmark I struggled through the rain on the road. Unfortunately, this was not what I had in mind. But I was also glad that I hadn't been out in such conditions on my previous trip.

So I cycled the route relatively quickly to spend the evening with friends in Flensburg. We ended the evening together with 3 delicious fish sandwiches in good company.

From Flensburg, I will take the train to Cologne, where I will start my journey home on the Rhine Cycle Route after 2 rest days.
