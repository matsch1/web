## impressions
When I got up this morning, the entire Shelterplatz was immersed in fog.Somehow everything was slightly wet.As a result, the meadow was full of naked snails and small frogs, which was kind of funny.

I was able to start in the sun an hour later.The first part of the route through the northern Denmark inland felt again like in Sweden.

When the coast came closer, clouds and cold seawind came with it.The plan to go swimming was somehow more and more unattractive.

However, the whole thing was not really dramatic because an absolute highlight of this tour awaited me.Between Løkken and Blokhus I was able to drive the entire route directly on the edge of the water on the beach.Who goes swimming or surfing if you can fly directly by bike on the beach.

After this great passage, I enjoyed the afternoon in and around Blhon with beach and live music until I rolled the last 15 km to my sleeping place.As every evening, I let the day end relaxed again today.
