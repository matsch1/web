## Impressions
When I got up this morning, the whole shelter was covered in fog. Somehow everything was slightly wet. As a result, the meadow was full of slugs and little frogs, which was kind of funny.

An hour later, I was still able to set off in the sun. The first part of the route through the northern interior of Denmark felt like Sweden all over again.

As the coast got closer and closer, clouds and a cold sea breeze came with it. The plan to go for a swim somehow became less and less attractive.

However, this was not really dramatic, as an absolute highlight of this tour awaited me. Between LÃ¸kken and Blokhus, I was able to ride the entire route directly on the water's edge on the beach. Who goes swimming or surfing when you can ride your bike along the beach like this?

After this great passage, I enjoyed the afternoon in and around Blockhus with the beach and live music until I cycled the last 15 km to my sleeping place. Like every evening, I let the day come to a relaxed end.
