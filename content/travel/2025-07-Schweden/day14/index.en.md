## Impressions
A short stage was on the agenda for today. After the last two longer cycling days, I need to relax a bit. My legs told me that in no uncertain terms this morning.

So I set off late at half past ten, after spending the morning having a nice chat at the shelter.

My first destination for today was the town of Esbjerg, which I reached after a long breakfast break at around 13:30. Once there, I treated myself to a delicious cappuccino.

From Esbjerg it was still about 25 km to the shelter I was aiming for. Here I was able to take a dip in a small river in the sunshine and relax after work.

Tomorrow is the last stage in Denmark. I have to cross another 100 km inland to Flensburg.
