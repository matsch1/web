## impressions
For today, a short stage was on the plan.After the last two longer bike days, I need some relaxation.My legs also informed me of that this morning.

So I started late at half past 11 after I had spent the morning with nice conversations on the Shelterplatz.

My first destination for today was the city of Esbjerg, which I had reached after an extensive breakfast break around 1:30 p.m.Once there, I first treated myself to a delicious cappuccino.

From Esbjerg it was about 25 km to the targeted Shelterplatz.Here I was able to bathe in a small river in a sunshine and take a relaxing end of work.

The last stage in Denmark is coming up for tomorrow.It is about 100 km to cross through the interior to Flensburg.
