## Impressions
The day started with sunshine and a coffee on a jetty by the lake at the sleeping area.
The night was relaxed and restful.

At the shelter site I met Alex, who was also on his way north. So we decided to cycle together that day. It was a welcome change in many ways. It wasn't just the two of us, we also had sunshine and sometimes even a bit of a tailwind.

We had a look around Varberg and just enjoyed our time on the bike. The day went by relatively quickly.

I'm spending the night tonight in a small Airbnb near Gothenburg. I should be able to get into the city relatively quickly tomorrow to catch my 12:15 ferry. That means I'll be back on Danish soil in Frederikshavn at 15:45.
