## impressions
The day started with a sunshine with a coffee on a bridge at the lake at the sleeping place.
The night was relaxed and relaxing.

I met Alex on Shelterplatz, who is also on the way to the north.So we decided to cycle this day together.It was a welcome change in many ways.We were not only in pairs, we also had sunshine and sometimes even some tailwind.

We looked at Varberg and just enjoyed the time on the bike.So the day changed relatively quickly.

Today I spend the night in a small Airbnb near Gothenburg.So I should get into town relatively quickly tomorrow to get my ferry at 12:15 p.m.That means from 3:45 p.m. I again enter Danish soil in Frederikshavn under my feet.
