## Impressions
The evening and night at the campsite went differently than expected. At least I was able to do some laundry and charge my batteries. However, about 100 m away from my tent there was a big country party with music and square dancing. As a result, all the Swedes were partying into the night, dressed as cowboys, not far from my tent.

Nevertheless, I was quite well rested this morning and was able to dry everything quickly without any problems and then set off on a short day's stage with surprisingly little rain. My tent withstood the heavy rain without any problems.

I have decided to believe the weather forecast that it is supposed to rain up to 30 l/m2 tomorrow. So I spend the next two nights in a hostel 60 km away in Mellbystrand and rest for a day.

This gives me a little time to reflect, plan the rest of my trip and fill my stomach.

Today, by the way, I have completed the first quarter of my journey. If I keep up the pace (and take one day off per week), then I will need about 4 weeks for the entire trip, as expected.
