## impressions
The evening and the night at the campsite were different than expected.After all, I was able to wash laundry and load my batteries.However, about 100 m away from my tent there was a large -scale country typearty with music and square dance.Accordingly, all Swedes celebrated into the night when cowboys disguised, not far from my tent.

Nevertheless, I was able to dry everything quickly this morning without problems and then start a short daily stage with amazingly little rain.My tent withstanded the sometimes heavy rain without any problems.

I decided to believe the weather forecast that it should rain up to 30 l/m2 tomorrow.So I spend the next two nights in a hostel in Mellby beach 60 km away and rest for a day.

So now I have had a little time to reflect on planning the further trip and doing my stomach.

By the way, I did the first quarter of my travel route well today.If I keep the pace (and a break day a week), then I will need about 4 weeks for the complete trip for about 4 weeks.
