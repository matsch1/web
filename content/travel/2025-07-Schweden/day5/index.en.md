## Impressions
Woke up this morning to pouring rain. Luckily everything stayed dry in my shelter.

After the rain subsided, I set off at around 10am and was at the ferry to Helsingborg in no time at all.

The weather was still moderate, but I didn't spend much time there and set off straight onto the Kattegattleden (the name of the west coast cycle path).

For lunch, I went to Höganäs and got a typically Swedish pizza at the kebab shop.

The day's destination was to be a campsite in Ängelholm to do some laundry and charge my devices.
I'm now writing this text in a large tent at the campsite while it's pouring with rain outside. I hope my tent stays waterproof. This is definitely a trial by fire.
Oh yes, I had my first proper shower since June 😀.

A short stage was originally planned for tomorrow to sleep in the hostel for 2 nights. But as the weather forecast has deteriorated again, I'll decide tomorrow morning how to continue.

I'm hoping for a dry night (with clean cycling clothes and a full power bank).
