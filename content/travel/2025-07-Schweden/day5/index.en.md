## impressions
Waked up this morning with pouring rain.Fortunately, everything stayed dry in my shelter.

After the rain let go, I started around 10 a.m. and was nothing in no time on the ferry to Helsingborg.

When the weather is still moderate, I didn't stand up there and started directly in the Kattegattleded (that's the name of the west coastal cycle path).

As a lunch, I got a pizza with the kebab in Höganäs, typically Swedish.

The daily destination should be a campsite in Ängelholm to wash laundry and load my devices.
I am now writing this text in a large residence tent at the campsite while it pours out of buckets outside.I hope my tent stays tight.This is definitely a test of a fire.
Oh yes, I've had my first real shower since June.

A short stage was originally planned for tomorrow to sleep 2 nights in the hostel.Since the weather forecast has deteriorated again, I decide tomorrow morning how it goes on.

I hope for a dry night (with a clean wheel clothes and full of power bank).
