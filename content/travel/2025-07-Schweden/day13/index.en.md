## impressions
The day today started comfortably.First of all, I drove in the wrong direction to see Robben with the hope.Unfortunately, that was denied to me.

So I drove to the south.The start of the daily stage was pretty tough today.Fortunately, I still had some tailwind.So I struggled through the sun and light drizzle until lunch.

As a reward, I first drove a large portion of burgers with fries and only got started again.

After another 15 km, I stopped again for a bath in the North Sea.

The remaining 35 km to the place of sleep, a little later than usual, started with music on my ears.

About 10 km before my daily destination, the rain finally caught up with me.In the middle of the street, with a single rain protection far and wide, I was showered completely.You have that when you dawdle all day.

Once at the sleeping place, the sun seems to have been again as if nothing had been.Maybe then my shoes will be dry again until tomorrow.
