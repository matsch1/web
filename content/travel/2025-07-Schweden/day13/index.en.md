## Impressions
The day started off comfortably today. The first thing I did was drive in the wrong direction, hoping to see seals. Unfortunately, I was denied that again.

So I headed south without a care in the world. The start of the day's stage was pretty tough today. Luckily I still had a bit of a tailwind. So I made it through to the lunch break in sunshine and light drizzle.

As a reward, I tucked into a large portion of burger and chips and was slow to get going again.

After another 15 km, I stopped again for a dip in the North Sea.

I then started the remaining 35 km to my sleeping place a little later than usual, with music playing in my ears.

About 10 km before my destination for the day, the rain finally caught up with me. In the middle of the road, with not a single rain cover for miles around, I got a complete shower. That's what you get for dawdling all day.

When I arrived at my sleeping place, the sun was shining again as if nothing had happened. Maybe my shoes will be dry again by tomorrow.
