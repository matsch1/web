This is a retrospective collection of my impressions of the trip around Jutland.

## Key data
Distance: 400 km
Elevation gain: 3,300 m

### Route
{{< komoot src="https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/2355727258/embed?share_token=a4iZJCXizOVr8XWf14T1S6izlj0LYXSk0xwGK27LqcDpCQtWPX&profile=1" >}}

## Preparation
### Food
As there are no supermarkets in the Icelandic highlands, it was also important to plan our food. After all, we didn't want to go hungry on our vacation. For 10 days, that's quite a lot. That means you have to pack a lot of meals, which can get really heavy if you don't plan well. So the whole thing was a trade-off between price, weight and nutrients.
Oh yes, and please note that there are some import restrictions for Iceland. For food, these are essentially the following:

- Plants and plant seeds
- Raw milk and raw eggs
- Raw meat and fish

The imported quantity may not weigh more than 10 kg and may not exceed a value of 25,000 ISK (approx. 170 €).

Breakfast was always muesli with powdered milk and boiled water. Otherwise there were light ready meals or nuts. TravelLunch is trekking food that is designed for just such purposes, but is unfortunately relatively expensive. We got water every day at the campsite or from running water.

The food alone, without water, weighed almost 8 kg for the 10 days.
To make life easier for the officials and yourself in the event of a customs check, you should carry a list with all the food and its weight/price. Fortunately, we didn't need this.

### Luggage
...
...

All in all, our luggage for the 10 days weighed about 30 kg - per person!
To be able to transport all this, I bought 2 large panniers and a large, waterproof duffel bag. Fully packed, we were ready for our adventure.
