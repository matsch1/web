### Route
{{< komoot src="https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/2355727258/embed?share_token=a4iZJCXizOVr8XWf14T1S6izlj0LYXSk0xwGK27LqcDpCQtWPX&profile=1" >}}

## Preparation
### Groceries
Since there are no supermarkets in the Icelandic highlands, it was also important to plan our food.After all, we didn't want to go hungry on our vacation.A lot comes together for 10 days.This means that many meals have to go into the luggage that can also be really difficult if planning is poor.So the whole thing was a trade-off between price, weight and nutrients.
Oh yes, and there are to note that there are some import restrictions for Iceland.This is essentially the following for food:

- Plants and plant seeds
- Raw milk and raw eggs
- Raw meat and fish

The amount introduced must not weigh more than 10 kg and do not exceed a value of 25,000 ISK (approx. € 170).
There are more detailed information, for example
[[0000011000000].

The breakfast was always muesli with milk powder and boiled water.Otherwise there were slight ready meals or nuts.Travellus is trekking food that is intended for such purposes, but unfortunately is relatively expensive.We got water every day at the campsite or from flowing waters.

The food alone weighed almost 8 kg for the 10 days.
In order to make it easier for the officials and your life to make your life at a time customs control, you should carry a list with all foods and their weight/price.Fortunately, we didn't need that.

### Baggage
...

All in all, our luggage weighed about 30 kg for the 10 days - per person!
In order to be able to transport all of this, I bought 2 large luggage carriers and a large, waterproof lakeack.We were able to pack fully packed for our adventure.
