## Welcome to My Blog

Thanks for taking the time to visit my corner of the web.

This page functions primarily as a blog where I document a mix of personal interests, focusing on two main areas: 
software development and travel.

Here's what you can expect to find:

**💻 Code Notes:** Articles covering observations, solutions, and key takeaways from my personal coding process. I aim to share the practical things I've learned while building projects related to DevOps, app development and homelabbing.

**🌍 Travel Logs:** Posts detailing my experiences, sharing travel tips, and documenting the places I've been.

It's a straightforward space designed to share information. Feel free to browse the topics that interest you most.
