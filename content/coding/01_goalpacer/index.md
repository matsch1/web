I am proud to say that I was able to build my first flutter app in 4 days more or less ready for production.

Before these days I hadn't any experience about flutter. But I always like the idea to easily build apps for personal use. 
After some failed attempts to build some useful personal apps over the last two years using python i heard about flutter.
So this month I had some free time and set me the challenge to learn flutter, build an android app and publish it to google play store IN 4 DAYS.

The app I've chosen is some kind of pacing calculator I can use for running and triathlon training. For this purpose I used a google doc so far. In only need a few simple string and math operations on a few pages, no backend required. This seems to be perfect for my first app, not to complex and I would use to optimize my training in the future.

The development process actually starts one day to early. With my plan I could not wait to start and build a coffee card app in the evening of day 0 using the [Flutter Crash Course](https://youtu.be/j_rCDc_X-k8?si=OqmFujJvhpzCYK5O) of Net Ninja on Youtube.
With the learnings I get from this tutorial I start at the morning of day 1 with my own flutter app called "GOALPACER".

In the next 3 days I was able to build this app using VSCO on my Linux machine. I managed to provide 4 functionalities: 

- Finish Time Calculator: Calculates finish time based on your pace for running, swimming and biking.
- Pace Calculator: Calculates the necessary pace for your desired finish time
- Heart Rate Zones Calculator: Estimate your heart rate zones based on your maximum heart rate
- Pace Converter: Converts paces from min/mile to min/km

Even if the design is pretty easy and far from perfect I am really happy with the result.

The last step is to publish the app on google play store. In the end this is more complicated then I have expected. At the moment I am in a state where I am searching for closed loop testers. As a private first time developer it is necessary to do a closed loop test with 20 people, before you can publish to the play store.

So if you are interested on the app or want to chat, feel free to contact me. I would like to get some testers from the community to get some independent opinions from different people.
