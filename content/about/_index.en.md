# Matthias Schäfer

I am an electrical engineer and have spent a lot of time immersing myself in various control engineering topics. I have been able to apply this expertise to projects for electric vehicles from various manufacturers - from working on high-voltage components to helping to design the software for electric drives.

In the process, I discovered something else: my passion for good software. I love automating processes, simplifying workflows and developing features that really help.
