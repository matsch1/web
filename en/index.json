[{"content":"Introduction If you’ve been following my Obsidian setup, you know I love keeping my notes synchronized across devices with Syncthing (My Obsidian + Syncthing Setup: A Self-Hosted Cloud for Notes, Backups, and More). But I wanted more than just syncing—I wanted to interact with my notes intelligently, anywhere, anytime.\nWhy Obsidian HTTP MCP? That’s why I developed Obsidian HTTP MCP, a lightweight server built on FastMCP that exposes your Obsidian vault over HTTP using the MCP protocol.\nWith this server, you can:\nConnect AI clients like Cursor directly to your vault, enabling natural-language search, analytics, and even automated note modifications. Query your notes on demand from scripts, dashboards, or any device that can speak HTTP. Keep it lightweight and fast thanks to the FastMCP foundation. Essentially, your vault is no longer just storage—it becomes an interactive knowledge engine.\nHow It Works Each note in your vault is treated as an MCP “packet.” The server exposes endpoints to read, update, or analyze these packets. Using HTTP transport keeps things simple, secure, and accessible behind standard firewalls.\nThe real fun comes with AI integration. You can ask your desktop AI assistant to summarize notes, find relevant information, or even generate content based on your vault—all by chatting naturally. It’s like giving your notes a brain of their own.\nWhat Makes It Nerdy-Perks-Worthy AI-powered workflows: Chat with your vault, analyze content, or modify notes programmatically. Cross-device access: Talk to your vault from scripts, mobile apps, or web tools. Minimal overhead: Stateless and efficient, perfect for lightweight setups. Hackable: Build bots, dashboards, or automation around your notes. Secure: Runs behind your existing security without requiring cloud services. Examples of Cool AI Interactions Natural-language search \u0026amp; summaries: Ask your AI to find or summarize notes in plain English. Automated note updates \u0026amp; generation: Let AI create or modify notes, draft meeting minutes, or generate flashcards. Vault analytics \u0026amp; insights: Track trends, gaps, and recurring topics across your notes. Personal knowledge assistant: Chat with your vault to answer questions, suggest connections, or recommend topics. Code \u0026amp; workflow automation: Use AI to generate scripts, organize notes, or trigger automated workflows. Setup Run the MCP server on your remote server in a Docker container with one single command. Add the client config to your desktop AI client (e.g., Cursor): { \u0026#34;mcpServers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;obsidian-http-mcp\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;transport\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://localhost:9001/mcp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;headers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Authorization\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bearer \u0026lt;MCP_API_KEY\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } } } } Start interacting with your notes. For a more detailed description, check out the GitHub repository: obsidian-http-mcp and start chatting with your notes today!\nTL;DR Obsidian HTTP MCP is a lightweight server that exposes your Obsidian vault over HTTP using the MCP protocol. It lets you connect AI clients like Cursor to your notes for natural-language search, summaries, analytics, and automated modifications. Run it on a remote server, connect your AI client, and instantly turn your vault into an interactive, AI-powered knowledge engine.

Vault: Obsidian notes live in a single folder. That folder is the source of truth. The magic is in Syncthing: every device talks to the server, syncing notes bi-directionally. That means I can edit notes anywhere (on my phone while commuting, at my desktop during coding sessions, or on my laptop while pretending to relax on the couch). Within seconds, the changes ripple across all devices.\nThe server is both sync hub and backup repository. So even if a laptop dies or my phone decides to go for a swim, the notes remain safe.\nWhy Syncthing? Because it’s basically the anti-cloud cloud.\nNo accounts, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in. Runs on everything (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, even routers if you’re into that). Peer-to-peer magic: devices talk directly if they can, fallback via relay if they can’t. Once set up, it’s “just working.” Easy to setup with Coolify It’s like Dropbox, but nerdier and without the creepy terms of service.\nObsidian Layer Obsidian treats its vault setup (themes, plugins, workspace config) as just more files. Which means: once you throw your vault folder into Syncthing, the entire setup syncs too.\nThat’s right: I can install a plugin on my Linux machine, and seconds later it’s magically available on Windows and Android. My hotkeys, my color scheme, my crazy plugin combos — they all follow me around.\nExtra Features This is where it gets fun. I didn’t stop at “just syncing notes.”\nGitHub Backup I run a cron job that pushes the entire vault into a private GitHub repo.\nWhy? Because:\nExtra safety net (never enough backups). Version control: it’s basically git history of my brain. Automated File Handling Sometimes, notes get messy. Attachments pile up, screenshots end up in random places.\nSolution: a small Python script (also running via cron) that cleans up and reorganizes things.\nThink of it as a Roomba for my vault.\nBeyond Notes: Syncthing as a Personal Cloud Here’s the twist: once you’ve got Syncthing humming along on a VPS, you’ve basically built your own cloud framework. Notes are just the start.\nGoogle Drive replacement: throw in any folder you want synced across devices. Done. Phone DCIM backup: my Android dumps new photos straight to the server, even when I’m abroad. They’re instantly safe, without me ever touching “Google Photos”. Pay attention to the disk space of your server. Images take much space then notes. I like to think of it as: Syncthing is my cloud OS, the VPS is the data center, and my devices are just clients.\nTL;DR Setup VPS with Syncthing installed → acts as master and backup hub. Clients: Linux, Windows, Android with Syncthing. Vault folder = synced everywhere. Obsidian config = synced too. Extra spice: GitHub backup, Python scripts, cron jobs. Bonus: Syncthing doubles as Google Drive + photo backup replacement. Closing Thoughts Most people pay for cloud storage. I prefer paying for a VPS and hacking my own.\nWith Syncthing + Obsidian, I get real-time sync, complete control, no vendor lock-in, and some extra nerd cred.\nIf you’re into self-hosting, data ownership, or just like to tinker with infrastructure, I can’t recommend this combo enough. It’s not just notes — it’s a self-hosted cloud ecosystem.\n","permalink":"https://blog.matschcode.de/en/coding/obsidian-cloud-sync-setup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are two kinds of note-takers: those who trust their precious thoughts to the cloud (hello Notion/Google Drive/OneNote people), and those who stare into the abyss and think: \u003cem\u003e“what if I built my own infrastructure for this?”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI belong to the second group.\u003cbr\u003e\nHere’s how I turned \u003cstrong\u003eSyncthing + Obsidian + a webserver\u003c/strong\u003e into a note-syncing, backup-happy, cloud-replacing monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-core-idea\"\u003eThe Core Idea\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eServer:\u003c/strong\u003e a VPS that acts as my “Syncthing master”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClients:\u003c/strong\u003e Linux, Windows, and Android devices, all happily syncing to the server.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVault:\u003c/strong\u003e Obsidian notes live in a single folder.

I spent about 2 days on the train, took a day off in Sweden and spent a day with friends in Cologne.\nUnfortunately, the south of Sweden didn\u0026rsquo;t really impress me on this solo trip. Most of the time, the Kattegattleden west coast cycle route ran through tourist regions, industrial areas or along main roads. Although this was not entirely unexpected, it was unfortunately confirmed. You can easily escape the hustle and bustle inland. Just a few kilometers from the coast, you drive alone through the forest, far away from people, supermarkets and shelters. However, as a solo traveler, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like that for several days. That\u0026rsquo;s why I decided to take the last ferry back to Denmark before Oslo.\nFor me, Denmark is the perfect mix of civilization and wilderness. You pass through towns and tourist areas at regular intervals, but you can get out of them just as quickly. You can easily stock up on food and still spend a lot of time in beautiful nature. As a solo traveler, I also find the shelter concept much more pleasant than the everyman\u0026rsquo;s right in Sweden. You get to talk to other travelers more often instead of pitching your tent somewhere in the middle of nowhere. So Denmark was once again a dream. Not only because the country is so beautiful, but also because the people are always super open and friendly.\nThe finish with Jan on the Rhine Cycle Route felt like civilization again. The section we cycled is also really beautiful, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have much to do with nature. Maybe it was because I was no longer alone, but the day trips also felt more like day trips. I was no longer a traveler, but simply on a nice day trip as usual.\nPictures Highlight auf dem Strand zu fahren Mein Gepäck Viele Zimtschnecken Strand Am See in Schweden zelten Fähre nach Schweden Gute Laune bei bestem Wetter Typischer Shelterplatz Costs Transportation The transportation costs are made up of the train journeys for arrival and departure, as well as a total of 7 ferry trips.\nArrival and departure ICE with bicycle: 91 Euro + 68 Euro = 159 Euro\nFerry trips: 107 euros\nTransport: 266 Euro\nFood My meal was a mixture of restaurant visits and shopping including drinks.\nEssen: 634 Euro\nThat makes an average of 30.20 euros per day.\nOvernight stays Overnight stays are made up as follows:\n1 x paid sheller pitch: 5 euros 2 x camping site: 61 Euro 3 x accommodation (Sweden + Denmark): 195 Euro 2 x accommodation (Germany): 81 Euro Übernachtungen: 342 Euro\nTotal costs All costs together add up to 1,242 euros.

I finished off the trip with another 300 km on the Rhine cycle path.\nJan joined the tour for the last few kilometers. As he was unable to organize camping equipment so spontaneously, we decided to spend the last two nights in accommodation. For this reason, I sent my camping equipment home by post the day before and traveled the last few kilometers with a pleasantly light pack.\nDay 1 was very relaxed with the best weather directly on the Rhine. We overtook 1000 other cyclists from the NRW Cycle Tour 2025 and accidentally took more detours than planned. The originally planned 120 km turned into almost 140 km. But that was quickly forgotten over pizza and cocktails on the banks of the Rhine.\nDay 2 started with a breakfast from the bakery on the banks of the Rhine in glorious sunshine. Unfortunately, a headwind somehow crept in afterwards, which made cycling along the banks of the river unnecessarily strenuous. Shortly before Rüdesheim, a cycling detour (\u0026ldquo;only for experienced cyclists\u0026rdquo;) crept in, which meant an extra 200 m of climbing over the adjacent mountain. After a coffee in Rüdesheim, we still had about 50 km to go through the vineyards in a headwind. Once we had completed this, we allowed ourselves to relax in the hotel pool.\nDay 3 started again through the vineyards. After some deliberation, I realized that the reason my gears had suddenly gone haywire was yesterday\u0026rsquo;s accident, which had actually bent my derailleur hanger. Luckily I had a spare part with me, which was quickly replaced.

In my case it works best like this:\ntitle = \u0026#39;Website title\u0026#39; theme = \u0026#39;PaperMod\u0026#39; defaultContentLanguage = \u0026#34;de\u0026#34; defaultContentLanguageInSubdir = true enableMissingTranslationPlaceholders = true [languages] [languages.de] baseURL = \u0026#39;https://\u0026lt;githubUsername\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026lt;reponame\u0026gt;/de\u0026#39; languageName = \u0026#34;Deutsch\u0026#34; weight = 1 contentDir = \u0026#34;content\u0026#34; [languages.en] baseURL = \u0026#39;https://\u0026lt;githubUsername\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026lt;reponame\u0026gt;/en\u0026#39; languageName = \u0026#34;English\u0026#34; weight = 2 contentDir = \u0026#34;content\u0026#34; The markdown files are generated like this:\ncontent - post1 -- index.md (original file) -- index.en.md -- index.de.md - post2 -- index.md (original file) -- index.en.md -- index.de.md How to translate Realisation of the auto translation using Github Actions and python\nSetup of translation environment in Github Actions workflow The first part of the Github Actions job is getting a python 3.12 environment and install the required dependencies.

In this article, I’ll share some key takeaways from the development journey.\nTable of Contents App Features App Development Choosing Flutter for a Cross-Platform Quiz App PocketBase as a Lightweight Backend Using Unleash for Feature Flags Deploying via Google Play Console Conclusion App Features Shellmaster is designed to make learning Linux commands fun and interactive. Here are some of its key features:\nMultiple Quiz Modes: Test your knowledge with different game modes, including timed quizzes and practice sessions. Difficulty Levels \u0026amp; Categories: Questions are categorized into easy, medium, and hard levels, covering essential shell commands, scripting, and system administration. Progress Tracking: Keep track of your performance and improve over time. Custom Challenges: Users can set their own challenges and compete with friends. Offline Support: Play quizzes without requiring an internet connection. Dark Mode: Enjoy a sleek dark mode for better readability. APP Development The next chapters are about my learning during the development process. If you are interested in some nice Flutter stuff keep reading. If you are only here for Linux and Bash check the app out on Google Play Store Shellmaster - Apps on Google Play.\nChoosing Flutter for a Cross-Platform Quiz App I chose Flutter because of its fast development cycle, beautiful UI capabilities, and cross-platform support. With a single codebase, I could target both Android and (potentially) iOS in the future. Some of the key Flutter features I leveraged include:\nCustom UI components: I built a custom AppBar (CSAppBar) for a consistent look. State management: I used provider to handle quiz state and user preferences efficiently. Smooth animations: Animated background color changes in the quiz questions enhance the user experience. PocketBase as a Lightweight Backend For managing quiz data, user progress, and authentication, I opted for PocketBase, an open-source backend written in Go. It provides a SQLite database, real-time subscriptions, and an API with minimal setup. Here’s why it worked well for Shellmaster:\nSelf-hosted control: Running PocketBase on my VPS gives me full data ownership. Easy integration: PocketBase exposes a REST API that Flutter’s http package can easily consume. User authentication: Built-in authentication allowed me to manage user progress across devices. I will add the possibility for user login in the future. Example: Fetching Quiz Data from PocketBase Future\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Question\u0026gt;\u0026gt; fetchQuestions() async { final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(\u0026#39;https://your-pocketbase-url/api/collections/questions/records\u0026#39;)); final data = jsonDecode(response.body); return data[\u0026#39;items\u0026#39;].map\u0026lt;Question\u0026gt;((json) =\u0026gt; Question.fromJson(json)).toList(); } Using Unleash for Feature Flags To enable progressive feature rollouts and A/B testing, I integrated Unleash, an open-source feature flag system. This allowed me to toggle features dynamically without releasing a new app update.\nWhy Use Feature Flags? Experiment with new features (e.g., a “hardcore mode” for experienced users) Enable/disable features remotely without requiring an app update Gradual rollouts for testing on a subset of users Implementing Feature Flags in Flutter final unleash = UnleashClient(appName: \u0026#39;shellmaster\u0026#39;, instanceId: \u0026#39;your-instance-id\u0026#39;, url: \u0026#39;https://your-unleash-server\u0026#39;); await unleash.start(); bool isHardcoreModeEnabled = unleash.isEnabled(\u0026#39;hardcore-mode\u0026#39;); Deploying via Google Play Console Publishing Shellmaster on the Google Play Store involved several key steps:\nApp Signing \u0026amp; Bundling: Flutter’s flutter build appbundle made generating an AAB package easy. Play Console Setup: Setting up store listings, screenshots, and descriptions took more time than expected. Testing \u0026amp; Release Tracks: Using internal, closed, and open testing helped catch bugs before full deployment. Review Process: Google’s review process required proper compliance with data policies, especially for user authentication. Conclusion Building Shellmaster has been an exciting journey, combining Flutter’s UI capabilities, PocketBase’s lightweight backend, Unleash’s feature flags, and Google Play Console deployment. The result is a fun and educational quiz app that helps users improve their Linux shell skills interactively.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested, check out Shellmaster on the Shellmaster - Apps on Google Play and let me know your thoughts!\nWhat are some interesting tech stacks you\u0026rsquo;ve used in your apps?

It ensures your codebase remains clean, consistent, and efficient as your app grows. In this article, we’ll explore seven practical ways to refactor your Flutter application.\n1. Use Parameters in Widgets for Consistency When building widgets, hardcoding values like padding or fontSize can lead to inconsistencies. Instead, pass these values as parameters to make widgets reusable and consistent.\nExample: Use parameters instead of hardcoded values class GreetingWidget extends StatelessWidget { final String name; final double _fontSize = 20; final double _paddingVal = 10; const GreetingWidget({ required this.name, super.key, }); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { final String greeting = \u0026#39;Hello, $name!\u0026#39;; // Internal parameter return Padding( padding: EdgeInsets.all(_paddingVal), child: Column(children: [ Text( greeting, style: TextStyle(fontSize: _fontSize), ), Text( \u0026#34;nice to see you!\u0026#34;, style: TextStyle(fontSize: _fontSize), ), ]), ); } } By defining paddingVal and fontSize as internal parameters, the GreetingWidget can easily maintained.\n2. Create a Global Parameter File The next step to creating internal parameters for consistency, is creating global parameters for consistency. All values that should remain consistent throughout your app, such as colors, scaling factors, or button sizes, store them in a global file. This file doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a special formatting. You can easily make it like this.\nExample: Global Parameters File // wrapperBox double boxWidthFactor = 0.9; double paddingVal = 10; double borderWidth = 3; double borderRadius = 10; double boxHeaderTextSize = 16; To use this global parameters in different files. Just import the global parameter file at the beginnging.\nUsage: import \u0026#39;package:\u0026lt;appName\u0026gt;/common/src/globals.dart\u0026#39;; Text( \u0026#39;Hello, World!\u0026#39;, style: TextStyle(fontSize: boxHeaderTextSize), ); This approach ensures consistency across the entire app and simplifies updates.\n3. Organize Your Dart Files Effectively A well-structured lib directory improves code readability and maintainability. A common structure is feature-based organization:\nExample File Structure lib/ |-- features/ | |-- home/ | | |-- home_screen.dart | | |-- home_controller.dart |-- shared/ | |-- classes/ | |-- funcs/ | |-- widgets/ | |-- utils/ | |-- themes.dart Refer to Flutter Professional Folder Structure: Feature-first or Layer-first? for an in-depth guide to file organization.\n4. Create Custom Widgets for Reusability If you find yourself duplicating similar widgets, extract them into custom widgets. This reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.\nExample: Extracting a Custom Widget class CustomCard extends StatelessWidget { final String title; final String subtitle; final double _fontSize = 12; const CustomCard({ required this.title, required this.subtitle, super.key, }); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Card( child: Padding( padding: EdgeInsets.all(paddingVal), child: Column(children: [ ListTile( title: Text(title), subtitle: Text(subtitle), ), Text( \u0026#34;Hello hacker\u0026#34;, style: TextStyle(fontSize: _fontSize), ), Text( \u0026#34;nice to see you!\u0026#34;, style: TextStyle(fontSize: _fontSize), ), ]), ), ); } } Usage: CustomCard(title: \u0026#39;Flutter\u0026#39;, subtitle: \u0026#39;Custom Widgets\u0026#39;); 5. Differentiate Internal and External Parameters/Methods When working with Flutter, distinguishing between internal and external parameters or methods is essential. Internal parameters or methods are private to the widget and typically have an underscore (_) prefix, while external parameters or methods are exposed to other widgets or parts of the app and lack this prefix.\nWhen to Use an Underscore Use an underscore (_) for private properties or methods that should not be accessed outside the widget. Internal parameters or methods are intended for use within the widget\u0026rsquo;s implementation only. Example: Internal Parameter with Underscore class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget { @override _CounterWidgetState createState() =\u0026gt; _CounterWidgetState(); } class _CounterWidgetState extends State\u0026lt;CounterWidget\u0026gt; { int _count = 0; // Internal parameter void _increment() { // Internal method setState(() { _count++; }); } @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Column( children: [ Text(\u0026#39;Count: $_count\u0026#39;), ElevatedButton(onPressed: _increment, child: Text(\u0026#39;Increment\u0026#39;)), ], ); } } In this example, _count and _increment are internal and should not be accessed outside _CounterWidgetState.\nWhen to Avoid an Underscore Avoid underscores for public properties or methods that are meant to be used by parent widgets or other components. External parameters or methods define the API of your widget and should be accessible. Example: External Parameters class GreetingWidget extends StatelessWidget { final String name; // External parameter GreetingWidget({required this.name}); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Text(\u0026#39;Hello, $name!\u0026#39;); } } Here, name is an external parameter passed by the parent widget, defining the widget\u0026rsquo;s behavior.\nBest Practices Use underscores (_) for private/internal properties or methods to encapsulate implementation details. Keep external parameters clean and intuitive to create a clear API for your widgets. 6. Scale Widgets Using Screen Size To make your app responsive, scale widgets based on screen size using the MediaQuery class.\nExample: Responsive Padding class ResponsiveBox extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { double screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width; return SizedBox( width: screenWidth*0.8; child: Text(\u0026#39;Responsive Box\u0026#39;), ); } } This ensures your UI adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and prevents your app from overflow.\n7. Usage of Providers: Managing State Effectively The provider package simplifies state management by allowing widgets to listen to changes and rebuild accordingly. This is necessary if you need the same data in different widgets (read or write). Here are two popular provider type I already used:\nChangeNotifierProvider Use ChangeNotifierProvider for managing mutable state. For example a quiz game app with a QuizProvider. If some widget modifies the quiz data with the help of the QuizProvider, every Consumer of the quizd data will be notfied.\nExample: Quiz Game App import \u0026#39;package:provider/provider.dart\u0026#39;; const GameUI({ super.key, }); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MultiProvider( providers: [ ChangeNotifierProvider( create: (context) =\u0026gt; QuizProvider(), ), ], child: const Scaffold( appBar: CustomAppBar(), body: Body(), ), ); } class QuizProvider with ChangeNotifier { late QuizGame _quizGame; QuizProvider({}); void loadGame() async { var questions = await fetchAllQuestions(); _quizGame = QuizGame(); _quizGame.init(); notifyListeners(); } void selectAnswer(int selectedAnswers) { _quizGame.currentQuestion.selectedAnswer = selectedAnswers; notifyListeners(); } void submitAnswer() async { _quizGame.submitAnswer(); notifyListeners(); } void nextQuestion() async { // await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 200)); _quizGame.nextQuestion(); notifyListeners(); } } The QuizProvider data can be accessed using context.watch\u0026lt;QuizProvider\u0026gt;() or manipulated using context.read\u0026lt;QuizProvider\u0026gt;().submitAnswer()\nFutureProvider Use FutureProvider for widgets that depend on asynchronous data.\nExample: Fetching User Data import \u0026#39;package:flutter/material.dart\u0026#39;; import \u0026#39;package:provider/provider.dart\u0026#39;; void main() { runApp( FutureProvider\u0026lt;User\u0026gt;( create: (context) =\u0026gt; fetchUser(), initialData: User(name: \u0026#39;Loading...\u0026#39;, email: \u0026#39;Loading...\u0026#39;), child: MyApp(), ), ); } class User { final String name; final String email; User({required this.name, required this.email}); } Future\u0026lt;User\u0026gt; fetchUser() async { await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate network delay return User(name: \u0026#39;John Doe\u0026#39;, email: \u0026#39;john.doe@example.com\u0026#39;); } class MyApp extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp( home: UserScreen(), ); } } class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { final user = Provider.of\u0026lt;User\u0026gt;(context); return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar(title: Text(\u0026#39;User Info\u0026#39;)), body: Center( child: Column( mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, children: [ Text(\u0026#39;Name: ${user.name}\u0026#39;, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)), SizedBox(height: 10), Text(\u0026#39;Email: ${user.email}\u0026#39;, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18)), ], ), ), ); } } Refactoring doesn’t have to be overwhelming.

But I always like the idea to easily build apps for personal use. After some failed attempts to build some useful personal apps over the last two years using python i heard about flutter. So this month I had some free time and set me the challenge to learn flutter, build an android app and publish it to google play store IN 4 DAYS.\nThe app I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen is some kind of pacing calculator I can use for running and triathlon training.
